# STAT351 Project
Heart disease classification using tree-based methods

## EDA
The EDA.R file contains the code to generate the visualizations showing relationships between predictor variables and heart disease as well as summary information like the number of missing values in each column of the dataset.

## Models
The Models.R file contains code to generate all the differently sampled datasets, build CART, random forest, and catboost models, evaluate the models, and create some visulizations for the best performing model.
